# Textual-Data-Extraction-and-NLP-Analysis

Project Name: Textual Data Extraction and NLP Analysis

Summary:
This project aims to automate the extraction and analysis of textual data from given URLs using Python programming. The process involves data extraction using web scraping techniques and performing text analysis to compute various variables as specified in the project requirements. 
1. Data Extraction: Python script utilizing web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy to extract article text from URLs provided in the input Excel file (Input.xlsx). The extracted text is then saved into individual text files with unique filenames based on the URL_ID.
2. Text Analysis: Another Python script is used to analyze the extracted text from each article. Textual analysis involves computing variables such as positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, average sentence length, percentage of complex words, FOG index, average number of words per sentence, complex word count, word count, syllables per word, personal pronouns, and average word length. These variables are computed according to the definitions provided in the Text Analysis document (Text Analysis.docx).
3. Output Generation: The output of the text analysis is structured according to the specified format in the Output Data Structure Excel file (Output Data Structure.xlsx). The output includes the input variables from Input.xlsx along with the computed analysis variables.
